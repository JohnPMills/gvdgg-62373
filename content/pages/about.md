      For many people, learning is a chore. Education is something to suffer
      through to achieve a piece of paper. It shouldn't be. Many also push a
      certain approach. They encourage silos and box-ticking. They treat
      learners as vessels to be filled and position the teacher as the font of
      all knowledge. **It doesn't have to be this way.**


      We believe learning should be enjoyable. It feels great to work hard on a
      problem and find a solution. To receive encouragement and follow or
      develop a new passion. Learning should be a collaborative endeavour. It
      should be creative. It should develop lifelong learners equipped with the
      skills needed to thrive in the 21st century. **We do things differently.**


      Instead of trying to fit people to a rigid system, we create the system to
      fit the people. We use intrinsically motivating activities (e.g., sport,
      exercise, video games, clubs, and team activities) to engage the
      disengaged. To ignite a love of learning. And, hopefully, change lives for
      the better.
