      - title: Half a Yard

        content: >
          Half a Yard is a school-based project that uses sport to support young
          people to achieve that extra half a yard in their performance.


          The project has two strands: (1) one-off workshops, and (2)
          half-termly in-school delivery.


          Our one-off workshops focus on helping young people to navigate the
          various challenges around coping with the pressure to perform and
          transitioning into performance environments. Whilst our in school
          delivery provides rigorously developed and scientifically evaluated
          six-week sports-based training programmes to enhance
          performance-related skills (e.g., communication, teamwork).

          EDUFU is a project that uses combines the greatest stories in sporting
          history to connect with and teach young people about topics related to
          character building, personal, and social development.  Our learning
          process model builds on decades of academic research in economics,
          philosophy,  and psychopedagogy to create problem-based scenarios that
          students work together to resolve. Although EduFu programmes can be
          delivered directly by educators, we encourage a blended approach to
          learning (where possible). Within our EduFu programme, we also offer
          small group and one-to-one tutorial support. As with all of our
          programmes, the content is differentiated based on academic ability.

      - title: Sports Debate
        image_alt: lorem-ipsum
        content: >
          Like it or loathe it, sport is important. It provides colour to
          people's lives. A playground for children and young people to
          experiment with their character. A commonality where friendships are
          formed. All to often, however, discussions in sport are superficial.
          They fail to get into the weeds, the nuance, the good stuff. This is
          where Sports Debate comes in.


          Each fortnight our team of experts, including five university lectures
          from the UK and US, come together to discuss the big issues in sport.
          We hope you enjoy our debates and if you are a teacher/lecturer,
          please feel free to use the content within your classroom. As we grow,
          we hope to be able to provide supplementary materials to help you hold
          your own debates.
